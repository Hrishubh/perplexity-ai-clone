					"What mattered more, he suggested, was that after generations at the margin of American life, transgender people had forced the court to reckon with their existence. “Regardless of the outcome in June, trans and nonbinary people have always been here,” Strangio said. “We are in it together. Our power only grows.” ... Chase Strangio of the A.C.L.U. (second from right) became the first openly transgender lawyer to argue before the Supreme Court in United States v.",
					"He has threatened to withhold federal funding from health care providers that continue to offer blockers, cross-sex hormones or transition surgery to minors. “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female,” one executive order asserted. “These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.” · On Wednesday, the Supreme Court delivered a new, crushing blow, upholding Tennessee’s ban in a 6-to-3 decision.",
					"The movement defeated “bathroom bills” aimed at trans people in states like North Carolina and Texas, persuading even some Republicans that such measures were unnecessary and cruel. Just five years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that employees could not be fired for being gay or transgender.",
					"Not long ago, the idea that a major Supreme Court case would turn on medical care for transgender children might have seemed far-fetched. But during the last decade, as L.G.B.T.Q. groups were notching victory after victory, the number of adolescents identifying as transgender roughly doubled; it is now estimated to encompass roughly 3 percent of American high schoolers.",

					"The Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft, who resigned a whip on Thursday night in protest at the government’s disability cuts, spoke against the bill because of her fears for disabled people, with many campaigners protesting outside parliament. “The vast majority of disabled people and their organisations oppose it,” she said. “They need the health and social care system fixing first. They want us as parliamentarians to assist them to live, not to die.”",
					"The right to an assisted death is set to become law in England and Wales within four years as MPs backed a historic societal shift in Parliament on Friday by a tight majority. Kim Leadbeater’s private members’ bill, which passed by 314 to 291 votes, a majority of 23, was hailed by campaigners as “a day for the history books, where facts have prevailed over fear.”",
					"Royal assent is widely expected by the end of the year – though opponents said they would continue to fight the bill in the Lords. It will give those with less than six months to live in England and Wales the right to an assisted death, after approval from two doctors and a panel including a psychiatrist, social worker and senior lawyer.",
					"Through the debate, proponents of the bill sought to argue that MPs could not allow the status quo to persist. The Labour MP David Burton-Sampson said his Christian beliefs had meant he was initially against assisted dying, but said the exertions from constituents, who described their loved ones dying in excruciating pain, had persuaded him to support it.",
